# Basic-Socket-Server
An example of a simple socket server with multithreading in Python. 
There are two parts to make this work, a server file and a client file. The server file must be running before you start the client file.
Currently it simply sends numbers from 1-50, but in theory it could be made to send whatever information you wanted.
